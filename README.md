# Extended Study on Garbage Classification

This repository contains the work and code related to the ENEL 645 Fall 2024 project, titled "Extended Garbage Classification System Study". The primary focus of this project is to develop and study advanced methods for classifying garbage using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
